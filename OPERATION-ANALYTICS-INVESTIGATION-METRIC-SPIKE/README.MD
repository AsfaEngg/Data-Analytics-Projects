 **Project Description:**
---

This project involves analysing a company's end-to-end operations. Operational Analytics is a crucial process that helps identify areas for improvement within the company. As a Data Analyst, I have worked closely with various teams, such as operations, support, and marketing, helping them derive valuable insights from the data they collect. One of the key aspects of Operational Analytics is investigating metric spikes. 

This involves understanding and explaining sudden changes in key metrics, such as a dip in daily user engagement or a drop in sales. As a Data Analyst, you'll need to answer these questions daily, making it crucial to understand how to investigate these metric spikes.
