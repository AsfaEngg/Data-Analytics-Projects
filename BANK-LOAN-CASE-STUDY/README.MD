## PROJECT TITLE
**PROJECT DESCRIPTION**
---

A data analyst at a finance company specializes in lending various types of loans to urban customers. The company faces a challenge: some customers who don't have a sufficient credit history take advantage of this and default on their loans. The main aim of this project is to identify patterns that indicate if a customer will have difficulty paying their instalments. This information can be used to make decisions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, or lending at a higher interest rate to risky applicants. The company wants to understand the key factors behind loan default so it can make better decisions about loan approval. Being a data Analyst at a finance company our job is to use Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to analyse patterns in the data and ensure that capable applicants are not rejected.
