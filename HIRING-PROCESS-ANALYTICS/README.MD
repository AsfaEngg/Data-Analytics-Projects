 **Project Description:**
---
The hiring process is a crucial function of any company, and understanding trends such as the number of rejections, interviews, job types, and vacancies can provide valuable insights for the hiring department. As a data analyst my task is to analyse the company's hiring process data and draw meaningful insights from it. My insights could potentially help the company improve its hiring process and make better hiring decisions in the future.
